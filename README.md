# whs
 a tired world where all the real heroes are dead and all the adventures have already been had, your characters are moping around trying to eke out a living through looting and miscreantism but even they realize they'd be better off as quiet farmers trying not to attract the attention of the local warlord, and he's just an incompetent drunk living in the ruins of a tiny outpost made by men a million times his betters, all anyone can think of is surviving this next winter, nobody's even seen a spell in generations, the world is so much older and stranger than it should be, but so familiar and tired it's hardly worth the bother, hasn't it gotten colder?, all sense of purpose gone from this dried-up husk, the carousing table is as likely to cripple you as any adventuring incident, it hurts just to breathe, instead of enchanted swords we have swords that are forged a bit more carefully and are somewhat sharper, places of high magic definitely exist but you wouldn't wnat to go there, jesus christ they'll kill you, the underground is a nightmare, if goblins actually exist they are the kind of things that live under your bed and eat your face as you sleep, welcome to WHEAT HARVEST SIMULATOR 4000
